title: Week 6
---

This week, we watched a video of Kevin Flemming's talk ["A Crash Course in Open Source Licensing"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIi-hIlCQM). He uses the example that someone named Bob implements a program that calculates the ideal amount of ketchup for a given number of fries and posts the code on a bulletin board to explain the concepts of *copyright*, *patents*, and *software licensing*. He does this by asking questions like:
- Would someone be allowed to take the code from the bulletin board?
- Would someone be allowed to talk about the code?
- Would someone be allowed to run the code?

These questions make the talk more interactive and allow the audience to think of these concepts using concrete examples. 

The key takeaways of the talk are that *copyright* gives the author of original work all rights to decide who can copy and use the work. There are a few exceptions, such as *fair use*, which allows people to copy snippets of the work for certain uses, such as reviewing the work. Additionally, since software is meant to be functional, i.e. the purpose of software is to run it, people are allowed to run copyright software.

Questions about *patents* sometimes come up when discussing copyright. They are related, but they are not the same thing. Whereas patents refer to ownership of an idea, copyright refers to ownership of the expression of an idea. Returning to the example of Bob and his ketchup solution, we're not interested in the idea (the general algorithm), but how that idea is implemented (the code), and what people are allowed to do with that code. 

Sometimes creators want to give others some rights or all rights to copy and use their original work. They do this through licenses. *Software licenses* specify who is allowed to copy the code, whether they have to say who originally wrote it, and whether they'll have to publish the code. Different licenses have different requirements of people who copy the code. For instance, the MIT License is a *permisive* license; it puts very few restrictions of how code may be copied and redistributed. In contrast, the GNU General Public License (GPL) is a *copyleft* license; it puts an onus on people to attribute the code, allow the code to be copied, and provide the code in a copy friendly form when it's redistributed.

So what does this all mean for people contributing to open source projects? The original license an author or maintainer puts on a project becomes the default license. Anyone who contributes to the project has a copyright on their contributions, and those contributions are licensed under the project's license. Should a maintainer want to change the project's license, they must first ask the contributors. Moreover, if the project's license is changed, that license doesn't retroactively apply to the project's older code. Anyone with access to a copy of that previous code (e.g. through a commit hash) can use and copy the code under the previous license. This is why it's important to understand your project's needs and choose the most appropriate license early on. 


## Activity
It's official: I'll be contributing to [Nextcloud Server](https://github.com/nextcloud/server)!!

I've started looking for issues to work on, and I've identified some that have the label `good first issue` but do not have the labels `needs info` or `needs triage`. They've been commented on by active members, and even if they're old, they still have some recent (within 6 months) activity on them.
- [2FA settings icons don't invert in dark theme](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/13643): This results in black lock icons on a dark grey background. Because of the lack of contrast, the icons are essentially hidden.  
- ["Shared link" activity entries without user name](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/9587): Make it possible to see who shared or removed a public link to a folder.
- [visual feedback if a note attached to a share was send successfully to the recipient](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/12590): Show confirmation when a send was successful, perhaps using a checkmark.

Before I actually start working on issues, I'll join the [IRC channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#freenode_#nextcloud-dev:matrix.org), read the [developer manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/general/devenv.html), and learn more about how the community does [code reviews](https://nextcloud.com/blog/get-involved-in-nextcloud-by-reviewing-pulls/).

## Contributions
A lot this week:

üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª  Mentored a Git workshop at a women's hackathon in Pennsylvania.

üì¢  Taught students about learning resources from ACM, the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/offers) by GitHub, and the [Open Source Student Network](https://ossn.club/) by Mozilla.  

üöÄ  Launched a [new website](https://hunteracm.github.io/), [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/hunteracm/), and newletter signup form for Hunter ACM. These updates will aid the club's efforts to foster a sense of community among Hunter students interested in computer science and technology: It is now easier for students to get in touch with the club and learn how to get involved. Additionaly, the website is made with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages in the club's GitHub organization. Hunter ACM members can join the organization and contribute to the website by opening issues, writing code, reviewing pull requests, and by writing tech related blog posts.
