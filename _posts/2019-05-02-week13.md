This week, we reflected on the the differences between the cathedral style of software development and the bazaar style of software development. In the cathedral style, development is centralized and only certain people or certain groups of people can contribute to the code and make decisions about the code and how to release it. In contrast, the bazaar style of software development is decentralized, more transparent (in that code is available throughout its development process, and it welcomes more contributors. The bazaar method is often promoted with the claim that "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow". This is because more people are allowed to work on the code as it's being developed in the bazaar model, which means more chances to catch an error that others missed.

I'm quite indifferent to the two styles of development. I've mostly used the cathederal model for assignments and for personal projects. I like the cathedral style for personal projects because I get a chance to explore, develop the specific skills I want to develop, and make my own design decisions. Using the cathedral method for class assignments doesn't give the same sense of freedom. I've enjoyed working in the bazaar style overall, but I'm sometimes overwhelmed by the amount of communication and checking in required.
