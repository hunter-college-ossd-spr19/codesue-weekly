## Discussion
This week, we considered open source developement through the criteria of two leading organizations in this space, the [Open Source Initiative's Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) and the [Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). There is a lot of overlap between open source software and free software. Both specify software whose source code is freely available and that can be freely altered and distributed. They differ, however, in their philosophies. Open source stresses *access to code*, requiring, for example, that a license "must not discriminate against any person or group of persons" nor "restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor" and that "source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program", not "deliberately obfuscated". In contrast, free software emphasizes the *freedom of users*. In fact, the Free Software Definition enumerates "four essential freedoms" for users. Access to source code is considered a precondition to a user's freedom to "run the program as [they] wish" and to study and alter the program as they wish. Nevertheless, users' freedom is paramount in free software, and access to source code is a means to this, but it's not an end in itself.

## Activity
We contributed to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)! ðŸŽ‰

This was my first time contributing to OpenStreetMap. It was helpful to have a mentor who demonstrated how to make edits and to suggest the types of additions I could make when I couldn't think of anything to contribute. I noticed that a portion of York Avenue had a bus route, the M86 Select Bus Service, but the stops on this part of the route were not yet listed, so I decided to add them. I liked that it was easy to find detailed wikis about editing bus routes and stations via an external search engine. However, I wish there were also localized wikis available. For instance, it would have been nice to have a quick reference that specified a standard way to name routes and stops. I decided to label the stops I added exactly as they were named on the MTA website. Whenever I edited a stop that used a different naming style, I added any missing information, but I didn't make any other changes to its entry. Next week, I will explore where discussions like this take place and how they are resolved. I might also visit the stops so I can fill out information like whether the stop is a shelter or a pole and whether there is seating available.
