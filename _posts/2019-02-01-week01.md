This week, we considered open source developement through the criteria of two leading organizations in this space, the [Open Source Initiative's Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) and the [Free Software Foundation's Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). There is a lot of overlap between open source software and free software. Both specify software whose source code is freely available and that can be freely altered and distributed. They differ, however, in their philosophies. Open source stresses *access to code*, requiring, for example, that a license "must not discriminate against any person or group of persons" nor "restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor" and that "source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program", not "deliberately obfuscated". In contrast, free software emphasizes the *freedom of users*. In fact, the Free Software Definition enumerates "four essential freedoms" for users. Access to source code is considered a precondition to a user's freedom to "run the program as [they] wish" and to study and alter the program as they wish. Nevertheless, users' freedom is paramount in free software, and access to source code is a means to this, but it's not an end in itself.
