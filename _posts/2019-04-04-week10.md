Hello, world!

## Activity
Last week, I was confident that I found the solution to issue I was working on (localizing open graph description tags). It is a solution, but it's the wrong kind. While the changes I make are reflected in the DOM, they're not being picked up by the tool that uses this metadata when the site's URL is shared. The tool simply reads existing HTML; it doesn't execute the JavaScript then read the resulting HTML. I'm a bit stuck, so I'll reach out to other contributor's via Slack.

## Contributions
None this week. ðŸ˜ž

I am leading an intro to HTML and CSS workshop, but this isn't attached to an open source project, so I'm not sure if it actually counts as an open source contribution.
