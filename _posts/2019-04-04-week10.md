title: Week 10
---

This week, we read the guides [Contributing to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia#Getting_started) (an overview of norms and customs for Wikipedia editors) and [A Primer for Newcomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:A_primer_for_newcomers) (a quick and simple guide for people who are new to Wikipedia). We continuted working through the Unix tutorial we started last Friday, so we didn't get to discuss them in class. The articles introduce [Wikipedia's Five Pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars) and outline what these pillars mean for people who want to contribute to Wikipedia. They also give practical advice about choosing an article to edit, enhancing articles with media (e.g. images, sounds, video, tables), being a member of the Wikipedia community, citing sources, and finding official wikipedia guides and policies. The lengthiness of these articles--which are meant to be brief, getting started references--immediately reveals the scale and maturity of the Wikipedia project. 

I'm a casual Wikipedia editor. I rarely visit Wikipedia with the intent of editing an article or improving the encyclopedia. Most of [my edits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Codesue) are minor edits that I make when I look something up and find an area of improvement. I would like to contribute to Wikipedia by [translating articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Translation) to Swedish and [Italian](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categoria:Tradurre_dalla_lingua_inglese) from English and to English from [Swedish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_translation_from_Swedish_Wikipedia), [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_translation_from_Italian_Wikipedia), and [Nyanja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Articles_needing_translation_from_Chewa_Wikipedia).

## Activity
Last week, I was confident that I found the solution to issue I was working on (localizing open graph description tags). It is a solution, but it's the wrong kind. While the changes I make are reflected in the DOM, they're not being picked up by the tool that uses this metadata when the site's URL is shared. The tool simply reads existing HTML; it doesn't execute the JavaScript then read the resulting HTML. 

I reached out to other contributors via Slack, writing:
> Iâ€™m working on issue 1051 (localizing the open graph description tag), and Iâ€™ve gotten stuck on two problems:
>1. When I update the tags with JavaScript, these changes are reflected in the DOM, but theyâ€™re not picked up by the open graph parser. Iâ€™m using the Open Graph Preview Chrome extension.
>2. I donâ€™t understand how to supply a message from a messages.ftl file to index_template.html.
>Hereâ€™s a gist of what Iâ€™ve done so far: https://gist.github.com/codesue/85e6bd6f4fb35d06e60c6e6d09bbe788

>Am I going in the right direction with this?

## Contributions
None this week. ðŸ˜ž

I am leading an intro to HTML and CSS workshop, but this isn't attached to an open source project, so I'm not sure if it actually counts as an open source contribution.
