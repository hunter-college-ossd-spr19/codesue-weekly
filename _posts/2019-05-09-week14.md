title: Week 14

This week, we read Tom Callaway's [Musings on Business Models for Open Source Software](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html) and we prepared our final presentations for this class. In his article, Tom lists and defines five models:
1. **Donation model** - soliciting but not requiring donations
2. **Open Core** - having an open source core codebase and selling proprietary software that's built on top of that codebase
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - offering open source software services that run on the company's infrastructure
4. **Peace of Mind** - being an intermediary between customers and open source projects
5. **Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)** - assuming your customers will find your own open source code too risky and selling them a more secure or less restrictive proprietary version (*I don't fully understand this model.*)

He writes that although most open source companies have an Open Core model, the most successful one, Red Hat, is not Open Core. They found that customers don't like being "locked in" with proprietary software, being forced to upgrade software and renew licenses. Additionally, in being open source, they are able to have a much larger development team and continue to beneficial for both their customers and their open source community. Moreover, knowing that customers aren't locked in provides and incentive to continually improve the software. With Open Core, there isn't as much of an incentive to improve the open source core while improving the proprietary version that earns the company money.  


## Reflections on this Course
As we prepared our final presentations, I reflected a lot on this course, what I learned, what my goals were, and what I managed to accomplish. 

### What I learned
1. There are many ways to get involved in open source beyond contributing code to a project. As I wrote in [my Week 2 blog post](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week02/):
> From GitHub’s How to Contribute to Open Source guide, we learned that there are many ways to contribute beyond writing source code. Contributions also include things such as hosting meetups, volunteering at conferences, writing tutorials, answering questions about a project on Stack Overflow, mentoring others, designing layouts, conducting user research, adding relevant labels to issues, and so on. This makes it possible for anyone to contribute to open source, in some way, regardless of their interests, skills, and familiarity with a project.
2. In evaluating projects, I consider how much effort a community puts in to being welcoming and inclusive. I also prefer to be part of a community that takes it seriously if a member is harassed and has policies in place to deal with such misconduct.
3. There are a lot of resources for students who want to get involved in open source, like [Mozilla's Open Source Student Network](https://ossn.club/).
4. Almost every presentation about open source licensing startes the same way: "I am not a lawyer (or I’m a lawyer, but I’m not YOUR lawyer), so I can’t give you legal advice. If it doesn’t have a license, it’s copyright; all rights reserved. It’s not open source if it doesn’t have an (OSI approved) open source license".
5. While communities of practice start organically, they don’t succeed organically. The success of a community requires intentionalilty and effort. There are deliberate actions we can take to build communities in which anyone who wants to participate can participate and do so in a way and at a level that feels comfortable to them.

### My Goals
Originally, my goal was to contribute to a project that impacts civic engagement, digital rights, or personal data privacy and protection. Idealy, the community would be beginner friendly, represent a mix of backgrounds (e.g. technology, law, activism, government, art), and have a local chapter in which members regularly meet in person.

After our project evaluation exercises, my top priority was to find a project that I could make meaningful contributions to by the end of the semester. I’d never contributed code to an open source project, and I had a deadline of ten weeks. Though impact was still important to me, I decided not to constrain myself to the areas I specified before. My ideal project became one that was active and that had adequate documentation and clearly labeled issues.

I chose what I felt was a worthwhile issue and put a lot of time into researching the problem and developing a solution. In the end, I was told my solution was the correct approach, but that it wouldn't work with the current project structure, so I won't be able to submit a pull request for this issue. This is frustrating because it took several weeks to get this feedback, and I was working on this issue as part of a graded course. Though I put in a lot of work, I'm worried that I might not have a lot to show for it, even though I gave progress updates in my [Week 8](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week08/), [Week 9 (activity section)](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week09/), and [Week 10 (activity section)](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week10/) blog posts.

An exciting outcome is that we recognized the need to teach technical communication skills and identified an open source "college to career playbook" that computer science students across CUNY campuses can help put together.

#### Totally revamped Hunter ACM's digital presence 

[**Check out my code and documentation contributions!**](https://github.com/hunteracm/hunteracm.github.io/commits?author=codesue)

I redesigned [the Hunter ACM website](https://www.hunteracm.org/) as part the club's efforts to foster a sense of community among people at Hunter interested in computer science and technology. The website now features information about the club's purpose, specific ways students can get involved, the code of conduct, and updated information about when it meets and the types of events it holds. The website is also faster, easier to navigate, and mobile friendly. It also links to other platforms that make it easier for people to find Hunter ACM via search, to get in touch, and to get news about upcoming events. 

The website is bright, inviting, and easy to navigate. When they arrive at the homepage, visitors are greeted with a banner that reads “Welcome to Hunter ACM!” and that prompts them to “join us”. We then show them how to join us: “attend an event”, “get involved”, “learn about the ACM”, and “meet the board”. Then, we let them know that “we strive to make Hunter ACM a safe, welcoming, and inclusive community for all our members” and we ask them to read our Code of Conduct. Finally, we invite them to connect with us through Facebook, Twitter, Slack, GitHub, and our newsletter. 

From the navigation bar, visitors can go to About (our homepage), Events (our Eventbrite page), Projects (our GitHub organization), and Contact (a contact form on our website). Limiting what’s on the website to essential information that doesn’t change often helps us keep the website up to date. We post information that changes often on more suitable platforms. For example, we list our events on Eventbrite. In doing so, we’re able to publish them on Facebook and Twitter with just the click of a button, they’re discoverable through Eventbrite and search engines, and we can easily get in touch with people who have expressed interest in attending.

Using Facebook and Twitter helps us connect to our members and potential members by meeting them where they are. They don’t have to go out of their way to visit our website or wait for our newsletter to interact with us or to find out about exciting opportunities. More importantly, these platforms allow us to connect with companies and organizations in the city, to connect our members to this wider tech community, and to amplify the accomplishments of our members.

Our Slack and GitHub help us collaborate during our in person meetings and remotely. This makes it possible for members to fully feel like a part of the club, even if they can’t attend meetings because they work, have a class during our meeting time, or have to leave campus early because of their long commutes. [Our website is actually hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/hunteracm/hunteracm.github.io), and it was built from a template using Jekyll. Members are invited to join our GitHub organization and [contribute to the website](https://github.com/hunteracm/hunteracm.github.io/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) by reporting bugs, suggesting features, writing documentation, and contributing code. Building and hosting the website this way makes it possible for everyone to contribute, no matter their skill level. It also makes the website a great tool to teach and learn about open source development.  I am currently the maintainer and primary contributor of this repo. Our GitHub organization also makes it easier to have activities like the [Milestones and Goal Setting Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/milestones-and-goal-setting-tickets-59305617699) and Cookies and Code Reviews.

Now, there are many ways to get in touch with the club and get news about upcoming events: 

**Website:** [hunteracm.org](https://www.hunteracm.org/) <br />
**Newsletter:** [eepurl.com/gjrbz9](https://acm.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=40574f669e2894fb2eb79e2b6&id=d40cd1198a) <br />
**Slack:** [hunteracm.slack.com](https://hunteracm.slack.com/) <br />
**Eventbrite:** [hunteracm.eventbrite.com](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/hunter-acm-19855593997) <br />
**GitHub:** [github.com/hunteracm](https://github.com/hunteracm) <br />
**Facebook:** [facebook.com/hunteracm](https://www.facebook.com/hunteracm/) <br />
**Twitter:** [twitter.com/weareHunterACM](https://twitter.com/weareHunterACM) <br />

I also registered the club for [G Suite for Nonprofits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/offerings/apps-for-nonprofits.html), created a board member onboarding doc, and created templates for board meeting notes, changelogs, event plans, and speaker invitation emails.
