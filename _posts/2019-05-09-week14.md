This week, we read Tom Callaway's [Musings on Business Models for Open Source Software](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html) and we prepared our final presentations for this class. In his article, Tom lists and defines five models:
1. **Donation model** - soliciting but not requiring donations
2. **Open Core** - having an open source core codebase and selling proprietary software that's built on top of that codebase
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - offering open source software services that run on the company's infrastructure
4. **Peace of Mind** - being an intermediary between customers and open source projects
5. **Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)** - assuming your customers will find your own open source code too risky and selling them a more secure or less restrictive proprietary version (*I don't fully understand this model.*)

He writes that although most open source companies have an Open Core model, the most successful one, Red Hat, is not Open Core. They found that customers don't like being "locked in" with proprietary software, being forced to upgrade software and renew licenses. Additionally, in being open source, they are able to have a much larger development team and continue to beneficial for both their customers and their open source community. Moreover, knowing that customers aren't locked in provides and incentive to continually improve the software. With Open Core, there isn't as much of an incentive to improve the open source core while improving the proprietary version that earns the company money.
