title: Week 14

This week, we read Tom Callaway's [Musings on Business Models for Open Source Software](https://spot.livejournal.com/327801.html) and we prepared our final presentations for this class. In his article, Tom lists and defines five models:
1. **Donation model** - soliciting but not requiring donations
2. **Open Core** - having an open source core codebase and selling proprietary software that's built on top of that codebase
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)** - offering open source software services that run on the company's infrastructure
4. **Peace of Mind** - being an intermediary between customers and open source projects
5. **Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD)** - assuming your customers will find your own open source code too risky and selling them a more secure or less restrictive proprietary version (*I don't fully understand this model.*)

He writes that although most open source companies have an Open Core model, the most successful one, Red Hat, is not Open Core. They found that customers don't like being "locked in" with proprietary software, being forced to upgrade software and renew licenses. Additionally, in being open source, they are able to have a much larger development team and continue to beneficial for both their customers and their open source community. Moreover, knowing that customers aren't locked in provides and incentive to continually improve the software. With Open Core, there isn't as much of an incentive to improve the open source core while improving the proprietary version that earns the company money.  


## Reflections on this Course
As we prepared our final presentations, I reflected a lot on this course, what I learned, what my goals were, and what I managed to accomplish. 

### What I learned
1. There are many ways to get involved in open source beyond contributing code to a project. As I wrote in [my Week 2 blog post](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week02/):
> From GitHub‚Äôs How to Contribute to Open Source guide, we learned that there are many ways to contribute beyond writing source code. Contributions also include things such as hosting meetups, volunteering at conferences, writing tutorials, answering questions about a project on Stack Overflow, mentoring others, designing layouts, conducting user research, adding relevant labels to issues, and so on. This makes it possible for anyone to contribute to open source, in some way, regardless of their interests, skills, and familiarity with a project.
2. In evaluating projects, I consider how much effort a community puts in to being welcoming and inclusive. I also prefer to be part of a community that takes it seriously if a member is harassed and has policies in place to deal with such misconduct.
3. There are a lot of resources for students who want to get involved in open source, like [Mozilla's Open Source Student Network](https://ossn.club/).
4. Almost every presentation about open source licensing startes the same way: "I am not a lawyer (or I‚Äôm a lawyer, but I‚Äôm not YOUR lawyer), so I can‚Äôt give you legal advice. If it doesn‚Äôt have a license, it‚Äôs copyright; all rights reserved. It‚Äôs not open source if it doesn‚Äôt have an (OSI approved) open source license".
5. While communities of practice start organically, they don‚Äôt succeed organically. The success of a community requires intentionalilty and effort. There are deliberate actions we can take to build communities in which anyone who wants to participate can participate and do so in a way and at a level that feels comfortable to them.

### My Goals
Originally, my goal was to contribute to a project that impacts civic engagement, digital rights, or personal data privacy and protection. Idealy, the community would be beginner friendly, represent a mix of backgrounds (e.g. technology, law, activism, government, art), and have a local chapter in which members regularly meet in person.

After our project evaluation exercises, my top priority was to find a project that I could make meaningful contributions to by the end of the semester. I‚Äôd never contributed code to an open source project, and I had a deadline of ten weeks. Though impact was still important to me, I decided not to constrain myself to the areas I specified before. My ideal project became one that was active and that had adequate documentation and clearly labeled issues.

I chose what I felt was a worthwhile issue and put a lot of time into researching the problem and developing a solution. In the end, I was told my solution was the correct approach, but that it wouldn't work with the current project structure, so I won't be able to submit a pull request for this issue. This is frustrating because it took several weeks to get this feedback, and I was working on this issue as part of a graded course. Though I put in a lot of work, I'm worried that I might not have a lot to show for it, even though I gave progress updates in my [Week 8](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week08/), [Week 9 (activity section)](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week09/), and [Week 10 (activity section)](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week10/) blog posts.    

### My Contributions

#### Community Building
Attended a [Open Source NYC Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Source-NYC/events/258592674/) and participated in a discussion about [their contribution tracking platform](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/codesue-weekly/week04/)

üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª Mentored a Git workshop at a women‚Äôs hackathon in Pennsylvania.

üì¢ Taught students about learning resources from ACM, the Student Developer Pack by GitHub, and the Open Source Student Network by Mozilla.

üöÄ Launched a new website, Facebook page, and newletter signup form for Hunter ACM. These updates will aid the club‚Äôs efforts to foster a sense of community among Hunter students interested in computer science and technology: It is now easier for students to get in touch with the club and learn how to get involved. Additionaly, the website is made with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages in the club‚Äôs GitHub organization. Hunter ACM members can join the organization and contribute to the website by opening issues, writing code, reviewing pull requests, and by writing tech related blog posts.

Led an introductory HTML and CSS workshop.
