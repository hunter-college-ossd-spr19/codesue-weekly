My name is Suzen Fylke, and I'm a computer science student at Hunter College in New York City. I'm a super-super-super senior! I graduated from college in 2015 with a degree in American Studies, and I returned to school six months later to get a degree in computer science. I didn't take my first computer science class until the last semester of my first senior year. It was a CS + X style class that taught introduction to computer science and programming with liberal arts applications. I absolutely loved it! I learned that I could use computer science to explore things I'm passionate about, like learning languages, listening to music, and drinking good coffee. I love building apps that make doing these things easier, and I like going to hackathons and workshops to learn the skills to do this well. I'm grateful to be a part communities of people who help each other grow as developers. Having a supportive environment where people can come together to share their experiences and knowledge makes studying computer science fun and meaningful.
